  This is a practice app for the written BJCP exam. (yes, the one soon to be replaced)
  There are ten pages. You can navigate by clicking the numbers at the top or bottom.

  New questions are randomly drawn each time you visit and any progress will be lost if you leave.
  You will have the option to Show Answers at any time but you'll have to make your own assessments about how well you scored.

  Relax, Don't Worry, Have a Homebrew. Please enjoy!</pre>
